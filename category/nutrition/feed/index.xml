<p>Good nutrition, like good training, is simple &#8211; learn the basics and practice them consistently. We have on our hands a zillion ways to diet, feed ourselves and live our lives for fitness. Let&#8217;s clear the air and put some things in order.</p>



<p>Good nutrition, like good training, is simple—learn the basics and practice them consistently. A little knowledge and a lot more discipline is the secret. Apply yourself diligently—look ahead, don&#8217;t look back and don&#8217;t look for shortcuts. There simply aren&#8217;t any.</p>

As you&#8217;ve noticed, there&#8217;s a gym on every corner and a glut of diet and bodybuilding formulas to pack on muscle and burn off fat. Competition is fierce, the promises are bizarre and we&#8217;re all confused, suspicious and eventually numb. We have on our hands a zillion ways to diet, feed ourselves and live our lives for fitness. Let&#8217;s clear the air and put some things in order.</p>
